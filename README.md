# Amazing-Space
This is my assignment submission where I was tasked to create a site that performs a variety of actions depending on screen size utilizing media queries. In terms of page content, it's about the vast and open space! This site utilizes HTML and advance CSS. (Unable to utilize pictures as they are not mine to use!)

You can view the live site at the following URL: https://mjihaduddin00.github.io/Amazing-Space/

Thanks!
